## What’s in This Repository?
We divided this book into 12 chapters. Here they are:
* ch01 - Introduction to data visualizations with D3.js – describes why D3.js and ES2015+ are the best options for creating data visualizations for the web.
* ch02 - An Archetypal D3.js Chart – analyses a typical D3.js chart example, walking through its code and reviewing the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.
* ch03 - D3.js Code Encapsulation and APIs – introduces different strategies developers use to encapsulate D3.js code, illustrating them with real-world library examples, and advising how to pick one of them.
* ch04 - The reusable API – presents this code pattern, which allows composable, extendable, configurable, and testable D3.js code encapsulation. It also discusses its advantages and drawbacks and how to overcome them.
* ch05 - Making the Bar Chart Production-ready – walks through the steps necessary to take the initial archetypal example and transform it into a professional and reusable chart.
* ch06 - Britecharts – introduces Eventbrite’s charting library, a set of charts and support components that follow the previous principles to help developers explore and interpret data.
* ch07 - Using and Customizing Britecharts – goes deep in the day by day use of Britecharts, showing how to compose the library components together to create compelling data visualizations.
* ch08 - Extending a Chart – extends the previous chapter by teaching how to extend Britecharts, modifying a chart, its documentation, and sending a pull request to contribute to the project.
* ch09 - Testing Your Charts – reviews on how to leverage the Reusable API pattern to test-drive a chart, using the initial bar chart as an example.
* ch10 - Building Your Library – illustrates how to build and publish an open-source charting library using Webpack, Babel, and npm.
* ch11 - Creating Documentation – demonstrates the generation of documentation from source code comments, using GitHub pages to host the docs and ESLint to enforce annotations.
* ch12 - Using Your Library with React – explores how to use D3.js within React.js applications, exploring different strategies and putting into practice one of them.
